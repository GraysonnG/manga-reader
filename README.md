# Blank's Manga Reader

First and foremost I want to thank the kind folks at MangaDex for providing the api necessary for
making this app possible

## Work In Progress

This application is a work in progress and thus does not meet the standards required by the api just
yet. I am not distributing this nor is it published anywhere.

## Getting Started

You will want to be using Android Studio and import the project.
Click run to start the application in an emulator or physical device. The min sdk is 27 and the
target is 33

## Technologies

* Jetpack Compose
* Material 3
* Moshi + Retrofit
* Accompanist Navigation
* Coil
* Room
* Koin
